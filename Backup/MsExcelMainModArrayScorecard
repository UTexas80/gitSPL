To compute the Williams %R oscillator using Excel, you proceed as follow:

1. Insert the high prices data for your stock in column “A” in Excel Spreadsheet.

2. Insert the low prices data for your stock in column “B” in Excel Spreadsheet.

3. Insert the closing prices data for your stock in column “C” in Excel Spreadsheet.

4. Sort out the Lowest Low price for the last 8 days “=Min(B1:B8)” into column “D”

5. Sort out the Highest High price for the last 8 days “=Max(A1:A8)” into column “E”

6. Compute the CH in column “F” by inserting “=(C1-E1)” =100 + ((F9-MAX(D2:D9))/(E9-Min(E2:B9))X100

7. Compute HL in Column “G” by inserting “=(E1-D1)”

8. Compute Williams %R in column “H” by inserting “= 100+((CH/HL)x100)”
